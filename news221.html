		<h2>Positive correlation identified between use of 'sounds good!' in communications and decrease of patience throughout the day</h2>
		<p class="subhed">Data from communications archives of Prof. Husain reveal concerning trends</p>
		<p class="byline">News 221 special report</p>
		
		<p>A new analysis of the various digital communications of a Syracuse University journalism professor reveals a disturbing correlation between the time of day, the use of the phrase of 'sounds good!' and a sharp decrease in patience levels in this particular academic, prompting concerns.</p>
		<p>On one particularly egregious evening, Husain mass-responded only the phrase 'Sounds good!' to several friends, family members and colleagues. In one case that night, a friend of more than 20 years had just informed the academic that he is getting married next year. On the same evening, Husain gave the same response to an irate editor who was requesting access to a belated story draft -- an email to which 'Sounds good!' would not, by any professional standards, be an appropriate response. </p>
		<p>"Sounds good!" responded Husain, in a frenzied rush to address all communications in a timely manner, and with patience levels dropping dramatically.</p>
